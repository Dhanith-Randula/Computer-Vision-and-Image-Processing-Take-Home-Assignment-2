###  Question 1 â€“ Otsuâ€™s Thresholding
- A synthetic image with two objects (square and rectangle) and three pixel intensities was generated using NumPy and OpenCV.
- Gaussian noise (mean = 0, stddev = 50) was added to the image.
- A **manual implementation of Otsuâ€™s thresholding** algorithm was developed and applied.
- Results were compared with OpenCVâ€™s built-in Otsu thresholding method.
- Outputs: Generated image with 3 pixel values, Noise added image, Otsu's threshold applied image.

###  Question 2 â€“ Region Growing Segmentation
- Grayscale image loaded using OpenCV.
- Seed points manually selected.
- Custom region growing algorithm implemented to segment regions similar to the seed pixel intensities.
- Real-time visualization included to show segmentation progress.
- Final output is a binary mask showing the segmented region.
